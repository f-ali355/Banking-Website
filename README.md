# Banking-Website
I developed a dynamic "banking website" using HTML and CSS, featuring MySQL database integration for customer data storage. I successfully hosted the website on 000webhost, ensuring its accessibility. This project showcases my web development and database management skills, emphasizing user-friendly design and security measures.
